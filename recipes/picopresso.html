  <h2>The Ultra-Portable Espresso</h2>
  <p>The Picopresso is the a really capable manual
    espresso machine, but requires some good skill 
    in order to make use of it's full potential.
  </p>

  <h2>Equipments</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Picopresso machine</li>
    <li>A Good, espresso capable grinder</li>
    <li>Scale at least to .1 of a gram</li>
    <li>Water boiling device</li>
    <li>Some receptacle for the coffee</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Freshly roasted coffee beans</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Weight 17-19g of coffee grounds</li>
    <li>Grind the grounds within espresso range</li>
    <li>Boil the water</li>
    <li>Pre heat the machine</li>
    <li>Distribute and tamp the coffee on the basket
      and porta-filter</li>
    <li>Brew the coffee:
      <ol>
        <li>Pump 8-10 times for the pre-infusion</li>
        <li>Wait about 10 seconds, it will start
          dripping</li>
        <li>Restart pumping at a steady, but not 
          rushed, pace, always weighting the output
          until the desired weight ratio</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Drink the coffee: it seems obvious
      but it is REALLY important. Make every 
      adjustment in your process based on taste,
      not on anything else</li>
  </ol>
